As a bare minimum, this file should include functions to read data and put it in a format suitable 
for further processing. 
Think of the following scenarios:
- Reading the data to get x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val
- Reading the data to get x_test, y_test
- Reading a single sample (for deployment)
You may also include functions to visualize the data
