       - :func:`mlq.l()` always tracks all scalar arguments given to a function that have a name using the function's signature
       
       - If you can later change the function definition then :samp:`MLQuest` may handle this by creating new columns that are empty for the previous runs.

       - :func:`mlq.l()` doesn't log collections to avoid having to deal with very large arrays. If your hyperparameter is a small array then you can still stringify it and log it using the :func:`mlq.to_log_ext()` method
